## 🎮 Pet Projects
Most of my pet projects are related to Game Development  
Whenever I have a free weekend I'm trying to find a game jam and come up with something cool in 48 hours  

### 🦖 Dino's Nightmare
That is the first game project that I have ever completed.  
The theme of the Jam was Hell and we decided to create a game about hell for dinosaurs...  
Now the poor dinos have to dodge asteroids for eternity  

🏆 Still proud of this tiny game, took 3rd place out of 56 other submissions

### 🪟 Windows Defense
Your good old Windows XP is being attacked by god knows what.  
Seems like even files from MacOS are here. Build towers and make sure to protect your precious computer!  
A tower defense game completed in a bit under 72 hours by 2 devs.  

🏆 Was rated #7 out of 123 entries in the enjoyment category

### 👻 Gentle gHost
An extremely challenging project where I was working in a team of 13 other devs, artists, and musicians.  
You play as a gentle ghost who is trying to help his relative and clean up the house without scaring her to death  
Think "Neighbours from Hell" but vice-versa and cute 😂  

🏆 Was rated #198	out of 6820 other entries.
